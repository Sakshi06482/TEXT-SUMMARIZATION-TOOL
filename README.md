*Project Overview* :

Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source to produce an abridged version for easier consumption. With the explosion of digital 
                
content, automatic summarization tools are increasingly important in applications like news aggregation, academic research, and report generation.This project uses classic frequency-based 

summarization methods. It tokenizes the text, removes stop words, scores each sentence based on word frequency, and then extracts the top N sentences as the summary.
